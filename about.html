          <h1> Our Why</h1>
          <p>
            The idea came from a past project meant to aid and supplement reading comprehension through conversation with AI. From our personal experiences, we comprehend best after a discussion with others.The problem is: everyone is not on the same schedule to meet and discuss. With Peer Review we hope to mimic those discussion for times when our schedules don't align. You work with it, it does not work for you.
